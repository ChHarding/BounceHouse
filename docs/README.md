# BounceHouse Developers Guide
BounceHouse is a MIDI controller that sends MIDI notes to the connected MIDI device when the pad detects a knock value.  The original idea was that the user would bounce balls in a room with the pad on the floor and when the ball would bounce on the pad, MIDI notes would be played.  However, the knock sensor could be used in a variety of different way and is not limited to this single implementaion making the hardware more verstaile.

# Hardware
SparkFun Thing Plus - RP2040 but any MicroPython MC should work - https://www.sparkfun.com/products/17745

MIDI Connector - Female Right Angle - https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9536

Piezo Sensor - https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10293

Breadboard, Jumper wires, etc.

# Piezo Circuit
A piezo connection to the ADC - https://docs.arduino.cc/built-in-examples/sensors/Knock

# MIDI Circuit
Standard 5 Pin connectors - https://diyelectromusic.wordpress.com/2021/01/23/midi-micropython-and-the-raspberry-pi-pico/
Pay attention to the section *A side note on voltage and currentâ€¦* and which resistors to use unless you board is 5V

# Software
Once everything is wired and ready running the code is very simple.  I used [Thonny](https://thonny.org/) to connect to the board and upload and run [BounceHouse.py](BounceHouse.py).  If things are working properly you should start seeing print statments to the console showing the knock sensor values being read.
