# BounceHouse Developers Guide
BounceHouse is a MIDI controller that sends MIDI notes to the connected MIDI device when the pad detects a knock value.  The original idea was that the user would bounce balls in a room with the pad on the floor and when the ball would bounce on the pad, MIDI notes would be played.  However, the knock sensor could be used in a variety of different way and is not limited to this single implementaion making the hardware more verstaile.
